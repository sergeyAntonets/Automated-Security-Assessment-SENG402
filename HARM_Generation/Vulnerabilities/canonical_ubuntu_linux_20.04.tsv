CVE-2025-5054	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N	Race condition in Canonical apport up to and including 2.32.0 allows a local attacker to leak sensitive information via PID-reuse by leveraging namespaces.     When handling a crash, the function `_check_global_pid_and_forward`, which detects if the crashing process resided in a container, was being called before `consistency_checks`, which attempts to detect if the crashing process had been replaced. Because of this, if a process crashed and was quickly replaced with a containerized one, apport could be made to forward the core dump to the container, potentially leaking sensitive information. `consistency_checks` is now being called before `_check_global_pid_and_forward`. Additionally, given that the PID-reuse race condition cannot be reliably detected from userspace alone, crashes are only forwarded to containers if the kernel provided a pidfd, or if the crashing process was unprivileged (i.e., if dump mode == 1).	canonical	ubuntu_linux	User
CVE-2022-1736	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H	Ubuntu's configuration of gnome-control-center allowed Remote Desktop Sharing to be enabled by default.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	Root
CVE-2023-5616	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L	In Ubuntu, gnome-control-center did not properly reflect SSH remote login status when the system was configured to use systemd socket activation for openssh-server. This could unknowingly leave the local machine exposed to remote SSH access contrary to expectation of the user.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	User
CVE-2021-3899	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H	There is a race condition in the 'replaced executable' detection that, with the correct local configuration, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	Root
CVE-2022-1242	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H	Apport can be tricked into connecting to arbitrary sockets as the root user	canonical	ubuntu_linux	Root

CVE-2022-28656	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H	is_closing_session() allows users to consume RAM in the Apport process	canonical	ubuntu_linux	User
CVE-2022-28657	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H	Apport does not disable python crash handler before entering chroot	canonical	ubuntu_linux	Root
CVE-2022-28658	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N	Apport argument parsing mishandles filename splitting on older kernels resulting in argument spoofing	canonical	ubuntu_linux	User
CVE-2020-27352	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H	When generating the systemd service units for the docker snap (and other similar snaps), snapd does not specify Delegate=yes - as a result systemd will move processes from the containers created and managed by these snaps into the cgroup of the main daemon within the snap itself when reloading system units. This may grant additional privileges to a container within the snap that were not originally intended.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	Root
CVE-2024-0115	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H	NVIDIA CV-CUDA for Ubuntu 20.04, Ubuntu 22.04, and Jetpack contains a vulnerability in Python APIs where a user may cause an uncontrolled resource consumption issue by a long running CV-CUDA Python process. A successful exploit of this vulnerability may lead to denial of service and data loss.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	User
CVE-2023-5536	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N	A feature in LXD (LP#1829071), affects the default configuration of Ubuntu Server which allows privileged users in the lxd group to escalate their privilege to root without requiring a sudo password.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	Root
CVE-2022-2585	CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:H	It was discovered that when exec'ing from a non-leader thread, armed POSIX CPU timers would be left on a list but freed, leading to a use-after-free.	canonical	ubuntu_linux	User
