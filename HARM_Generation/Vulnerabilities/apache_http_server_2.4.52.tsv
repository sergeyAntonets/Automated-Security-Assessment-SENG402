CVE-2024-42516	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N	HTTP response splitting in the core of Apache HTTP Server allows an attacker who can manipulate the Content-Type response headers of applications hosted or proxied by the server can split the HTTP response.  This vulnerability was described as CVE-2023-38709 but the patch included in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 did not address the issue.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which fixes this issue.	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2024-43204	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N	SSRF in Apache HTTP Server with mod_proxy loaded allows an attacker to send outbound proxy requests to a URL controlled by the attacker.  Requires an unlikely configuration where mod_headers is configured to modify the Content-Type request or response header with a value provided in the HTTP request.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64 which fixes this issue.	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2024-43394	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N	Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via  mod_rewrite or apache expressions that pass unvalidated request input.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.0 through 2.4.63.  Note:  The Apache HTTP Server Project will be setting a higher bar for accepting vulnerability reports regarding SSRF via UNC paths.   The server offers limited protection against administrators directing the server to open UNC paths. Windows servers should limit the hosts they will connect over via SMB based on the nature of NTLM authentication.	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2024-47252	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N	"Insufficient escaping of user-supplied data in mod_ssl in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.63 and earlier allows an untrusted SSL/TLS client to insert escape characters into log files in some configurations.  In a logging configuration where CustomLog is used with ""%{varname}x"" or ""%{varname}c"" to log variables provided by mod_ssl such as SSL_TLS_SNI, no escaping is performed by either mod_log_config or mod_ssl and unsanitized data provided by the client may appear in log files."	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2025-23048	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N	In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server 2.4.35 through to 2.4.63, an access control bypass by trusted clients is possible using TLS 1.3 session resumption.  Configurations are affected when mod_ssl is configured for multiple virtual hosts, with each restricted to a different set of trusted client certificates (for example with a different SSLCACertificateFile/Path setting). In such a case, a client trusted to access one virtual host may be able to access another virtual host, if SSLStrictSNIVHostCheck is not enabled in either virtual host.	apache	http_server	None
CVE-2025-49630	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H	"In certain proxy configurations, a denial of service attack against Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.26 through to 2.4.63 can be triggered by untrusted clients causing an assertion in mod_proxy_http2.  Configurations affected are a reverse proxy is configured for an HTTP/2 backend, with ProxyPreserveHost set to ""on""."	apache	http_server	None
CVE-2025-49812	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N	"In some mod_ssl configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions through to 2.4.63, an HTTP desynchronisation attack allows a man-in-the-middle attacker to hijack an HTTP session via a TLS upgrade.  Only configurations using ""SSLEngine optional"" to enable TLS upgrades are affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which removes support for TLS upgrade."	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2025-53020	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H	Late Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in Apache HTTP Server.  This issue affects Apache HTTP Server: from 2.4.17 up to 2.4.63.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.64, which fixes the issue.	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2024-38472	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N	"SSRF in Apache HTTP Server on Windows allows to potentially leak NTLM hashes to a malicious server via SSRF and malicious requests or content  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60 which fixes this issue.  Note: Existing configurations that access UNC paths will have to configure new directive ""UNCList"" to allow access during request processing."	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2024-38473	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H	Encoding problem in mod_proxy in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows request URLs with incorrect encoding to be sent to backend services, potentially bypassing authentication via crafted requests. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.	apache	http_server	User
CVE-2024-38474	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H	"Substitution encoding issue in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows attacker to execute scripts in directories permitted by the configuration but not directly reachable by any URL or source disclosure of scripts meant to only to be executed as CGI.  Users are recommended to upgrade to version 2.4.60, which fixes this issue.  Some RewriteRules that capture and substitute unsafely will now fail unless rewrite flag ""UnsafeAllow3F"" is specified."	apache	http_server	Root
CVE-2024-38475	CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N	"Improper escaping of output in mod_rewrite in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.59 and earlier allows an attacker to map URLs to filesystem locations that are permitted to be served by the server but are not intentionally/directly reachable by any URL, resulting in code execution or source code disclosure.   Substitutions in server context that use a backreferences or variables as the first segment of the substitution are affected.  Some unsafe RewiteRules will be broken by this change and the rewrite flag ""UnsafePrefixStat"" can be used to opt back in once ensuring the substitution is appropriately constrained."	apache	http_server	Root
