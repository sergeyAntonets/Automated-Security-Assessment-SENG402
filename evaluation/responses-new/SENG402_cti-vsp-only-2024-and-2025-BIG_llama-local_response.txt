First, we need to convert the base metrics to their corresponding scores:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (N) = 3.25
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Low (L) = 0.85
- **Privileges Required (PR)**: None (N) = 0
- **User Interaction (UI)**: None (N) = 0
- **Scope (S)**: Unchanged (U) = 0
- **Confidentiality (C)**: High (H) = 3.3
- **Integrity (I)**: High (H) = 3.3
- **Availability (A)**: High (H) = 3.3

Now, let's calculate the Base Score:

Base Score = (3.25 + 0.85 + 0 + 0) + (3.3 + 3.3 + 3.3)
Base Score = 4.1 + 9.9
