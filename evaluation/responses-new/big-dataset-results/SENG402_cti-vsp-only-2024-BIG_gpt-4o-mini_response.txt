To analyze the CVE description and calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we will evaluate each of the base metrics based on the provided information.

1. **Attack Vector (AV)**: The attack vector is **Network (N)** because the vulnerability can be exploited over the network by accessing the device's management page.

2. **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The attack complexity is **Low (L)** since the description indicates that a logged-in user can exploit the vulnerability by performing specific operations, which does not require advanced skills or conditions.

3. **Privileges Required (PR)**: The privileges required are **Low (L)** because the attacker must be a logged-in user, but does not need elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

4. **User Interaction (UI)**: User interaction is **Required (R)** since the logged-in user must perform specific operations to enable the debug function.

5. **Scope (S)**: The scope is **Unchanged (U)** because the exploitation of the vulnerability does not affect other components or systems outside of the vulnerable device.

6. **Confidentiality (C)**: The confidentiality impact is **High (H)** because arbitrary OS commands can be executed, which may lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information.

7. **Integrity (I)**: The integrity impact is **High (H)** since the configuration settings of the device may be altered, which can compromise the integrity of the device's operation.

8. **Availability (A)**: The availability impact is **Low (L)** as the description does not indicate that the device will be rendered completely unavailable, but it may affect its functionality.
