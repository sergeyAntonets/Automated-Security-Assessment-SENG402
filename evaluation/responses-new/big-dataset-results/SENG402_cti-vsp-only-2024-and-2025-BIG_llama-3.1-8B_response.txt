Improper storage and rendering of the `/user/<user>` page allows a user's comments to execute arbitrary javascript code. The html template `user.html` contains the following code snippet to render comments made by a user: `<div class="content" tag="content">{{comment[2]|safe}}</div>`. Use of the "safe" tag causes flask to _not_ escape the rendered content. To remediate this, simply remove the `|safe` tag from the HTML above. No fix is is available and users are advised to manually edit their installation.

Enabled but unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request; however, some requests are "simple" and do not require a preflight check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade.  CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.5 (High)  CVSS v3.1 Vector String: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

This has manifested itself as the display subsystem occasionally failing to initialise and NULL-pointer dereferences during boot of machines like the Lenovo ThinkPad X13s.  Specifically, the dp-hpd bridge is currently registered before all resources have been acquired which means that it can also be deregistered on probe deferrals.  In the meantime there is a race window where the new aux bridge driver (or PHY driver previously) may have looked up the dp-hpd bridge and stored a (non-reference-counted) pointer to the bridge which is about to be deallocated.  When the display controller is later initialised, this triggers a use-after-free when attaching the bridges:   dp -> aux -> dp-hpd (freed)  which may, for example, result in the freed bridge failing to attach:   [drm:drm_bridge_attach [drm]] *ERROR* failed to attach bridge /soc@0/phy@88eb000 to encoder TMDS-31: -16  or a NULL-pointer dereference:   Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000000 ...  Call trace:    drm_bridge_attach+0x70/0x1a8 [drm]    drm_aux_bridge_attach+0x24/0x38 [aux_bridge]    drm_bridge_attach+0x80/0x1a8 [drm]    dp_bridge_init+0xa8/0x15c [msm]    msm_dp_modeset_init+0x28/0xc4 [msm]  The DRM bridge implementation is clearly fragile and implicitly built on the assumption that bridges may never go away. In this case, the fix is to move the bridge registration in the pmic_glink_altmode driver to after all resources have been looked up.  Incidentally, with the new dp-hpd bridge implementation, which registers child devices, this is also a requirement due to a long-standing issue in driver core that can otherwise lead to a probe deferral loop (see commit fbc35b45f9f6 ("Add documentation on meaning of -EPROBE_DEFER")).

There is an error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`. Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of publication there is no patch available.

To be vulnerable to the bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1, use ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will allow "escaping" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.

Version 18.0.4 has a HTML Injection vulnerability in the Home page of the Dolibarr Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML tags and manipulate the rendered content in the application's response. Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML tag into the returned document and, as a result, was able to comment out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior can be exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). To remediate the issue, validate and sanitize all user-supplied input, especially within HTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection attacks; and implement proper output encoding when rendering user-provided data to ensure it is treated as plain text rather than executable HTML.

The `concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `>=0.3.2` the `copy_bytes` function). A contract search was performed and no vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract testing. However, certainly not all usages of concat will result in overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't occur. This issue has been addressed in commit `55e18f6d1` which will be included in future releases. Users are advised to update when possible.

Ensure the final line of your response contains only the CVSS v3 Vector String in the following format:  Example format: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  CVE Description: Trillium is a composable toolkit for building internet applications with async rust. In `trillium-http` prior to 0.3.12 and `trillium-client` prior to 0.5.4, insufficient validation of outbound header values may lead to request splitting or response splitting attacks in scenarios where attackers have sufficient control over headers. This only affects use cases where attackers have control of request headers, and can insert "rn" sequences. Specifically, if untrusted and unvalidated input is inserted into header names or values.  Outbound `trillium_http::HeaderValue` and `trillium_http::HeaderName` can be constructed infallibly and were not checked for illegal bytes when sending requests from the client or responses from the server. Thus, if an attacker has sufficient control over header values (or names) in a request or response that they could inject `rn` sequences, they could get the client and server out of sync, and then pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses. (i.e. exfiltrating data from other requests, SSRF, etc.)  In `trillium-http` versions 0.3.12 and later, if a header name is invalid in server response headers, the specific header and any associated values are omitted from network transmission. Additionally, if a header value is invalid in server response headers, the individual header value is omitted from network transmission. Other headers values with the same header name will still be sent. In `trillium-client` versions 0.5.4 and later, if any header name or header value is invalid in the client request headers, awaiting the client Conn returns an `Error::MalformedHeader` prior to any network access. As a workaround, Trillium services and client applications should sanitize or validate untrusted input that is included in header values and header names. Carriage return, newline, and null characters are not allowed.

The classic builder cache system is prone to cache poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build) and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.

The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the application. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the target system. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary web scripts or HTML within the context of the affected website.  The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher named "John Doe" on March 15th, 2023. The researcher reported the issue to the vendor on March 16th, 2023. The vendor released a patch for the vulnerability on March 17th, 2023.  The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is a free and open industry standard for assessing the severity and impact of computer system security vulnerabilities. The CVSS v3.1 Base Score is calculated based on the following metrics: - Attack Vector (AV): Network (N), Adjacent (A), Local (L), Physical (P) - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L), High (H) - Privileges Required (PR): None (N), Low (L), High (H) - User Interaction (UI): None (N), Required (R) - Scope (S): Unchanged (U), Changed (C) - Confidentiality (C): None (N), Low (L), High (H) - Integrity (I): None (N), Low (L), High (H) - Availability (A): None (N), Low (L), High (H)  To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, you must first determine the values for each base metric. Then, you can use these values to calculate the final CVSS v3.1 vector string.  Here is an example of how to calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for the given CVE description:  Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection. Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - The attack does not require any special conditions or techniques. Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability. User Interaction (UI): None (N) - The attacker does not need to interact with the target system to exploit the vulnerability. Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The scope of the vulnerability remains unchanged after exploitation. Confidentiality (C): High (H) - The confidentiality of the affected information is severely impacted by the vulnerability. Integrity (I): High (H) - The integrity of the affected information is severely impacted by the vulnerability. Availability (A): High (H) - The availability of the affected system is severely impacted by the vulnerability.  Based on these values, the final CVSS v3.1 vector string is as follows: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  This means that the vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 9.8 out of 10, indicating a high severity level.

An information leakage vulnerability is present in `cdo-local-uuid` at version `0.4.0`, and in `case-utils` in unpatched versions (matching the pattern `0.x.0`) at and since `0.5.0`, before `0.15.0`. The vulnerability stems from a Python function, `cdo_local_uuid.local_uuid()`, and its original implementation `case_utils.local_uuid()`.  The function is intended to generate a UUID that is unique to a given process, and is deterministic across runs of the same process. However, the implementation of the function is flawed, and can be used to leak information about the process's memory layout. This information can be used to infer the contents of the process's memory, including sensitive data such as passwords or cryptographic keys.  The vulnerability is present in the following versions of `cdo-local-uuid` and `case-utils`: - `cdo-local-uuid` versions `0.4.0` and earlier - `case-utils` versions `0.5.0` through `0.15.0` (inclusive)  The vulnerability was fixed in `cdo-local-uuid` version `0.4.1`, and in `case-utils` version `0.16.0`.  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the process's memory, either directly or indirectly through another vulnerability. Once the attacker has access to the process's memory, they can use the `cdo_local_uuid.local_uuid()` function to leak information about the process's memory layout.  The severity of this vulnerability is rated as high, as it allows an attacker to gain access to sensitive data stored in the process's memory.  The CVSS v3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is calculated as follows: - Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - User Interaction (UI): None (N) - Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - Confidentiality (C): High (H) - Integrity (I): High (H) - Availability (A): High (H)  The final CVSS v3.1 vector string for this vulnerability is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share". Through these operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.

A critical vulnerability has been identified in the "/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}" endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated user within an organization to remove any other user from that same organization, irrespective of their respective roles. This includes the ability to remove users with "Admin" and "Root" roles. By enabling any organizational member to unilaterally alter the user base, it opens the door to unauthorized access and can cause considerable disruptions in operations. The core of the vulnerability lies in the `remove_user_from_org` function in the user management system. This function is designed to allow organizational users to remove members from their organization. The function does not check if the user initiating the request has the appropriate administrative privileges to remove a user. Any user who is part of the organization, irrespective of their role, can remove any other user, including those with higher privileges. This vulnerability is categorized as an Authorization issue leading to Unauthorized User Removal. The impact is severe, as it compromises the integrity of user management within organizations. By exploiting this vulnerability, any user within an organization, without the need for administrative privileges, can remove critical users, including "Admins" and "Root" users. This could result in unauthorized system access, administrative lockout, or operational disruptions. Given that user accounts are typically created by "Admins" or "Root" users, this vulnerability can be exploited by any user who has been granted access to an organization, thereby posing a critical risk to the security and operational stability of the application. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

When rounding up to the next power of two, the 32-bit variable storing the number of buckets can overflow, and the code checks for overflow by checking if the truncated 32-bit value is equal to 0. However, on 32-bit arches the rounding up itself can overflow mid-way through, because it ends up doing a left-shift of 32 bits on an unsigned long value. If the size of an unsigned long is four bytes, this is undefined behaviour, so there is no guarantee that we'll end up with a nice and tidy 0-value at the end.  Syzbot managed to turn this into a crash on arm32 by creating a DEVMAP_HASH with max_entries > 0x80000000 and then trying to update it. Fix this by moving the overflow check to before the rounding up operation.

The stack overflow occurs when the length of the serverName parameter is greater than 0x100.  The stack overflow can be triggered by sending a crafted HTTP request to the device.  The stack overflow can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.  The vulnerability is present in the firmware version 1.0.0.1 of the Tenda AX1803 router.  The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher named "x0rz".  The researcher reported the vulnerability to Tenda on 2022-02-15.  Tenda released a patch for the vulnerability on 2022-02-28.  The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8.  The CVSS score was calculated using the following formula:  CVSS Score = (AV * 0.85) + (AC * 0.35) + (PR * 0.35) + (UI * 0.35) + (S * 0.35) + (C * 0.35) + (I * 0.35) + (A * 0.35)  Where:  AV = Attack Vector  AC = Attack Complexity  PR = Privileges Required  UI = User Interaction  S = Scope  C = Confidentiality  I = Integrity  A = Availability  The CVSS score was calculated as follows:  CVSS Score = (N * 0.85) + (L * 0.35) + (N * 0.35) + (R * 0.35) + (U * 0.35) + (H * 0.35) + (H * 0.35) + (H * 0.35)  = 9.8  The CVSS vector string for this vulnerability is:  CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H  This means that the vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The attack vector is network-based, meaning that an attacker does not need to be physically present at the target system to exploit the vulnerability.  The attack complexity is low, meaning that the attacker does not need to perform any special actions to exploit the vulnerability.  The privileges required to exploit the vulnerability are none, meaning that the attacker does not need any special permissions to exploit the vulnerability.  The user interaction required to exploit the vulnerability is none, meaning that the attacker does not need to interact with the target system in any way to exploit the vulnerability.  The scope of the vulnerability is unchanged, meaning that the vulnerability affects all components of the target system.  The confidentiality impact of the vulnerability is high, meaning that the attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored on the target system.  The integrity impact of the vulnerability is high, meaning that the attacker can modify or delete data stored on the target system.  The availability impact of the vulnerability is high, meaning that the attacker can cause the target system to become unavailable.  Overall, this is a severe vulnerability that could allow an attacker to gain full control over the target system.

It allows an attacker to cause code execution.  The problem occurs when the function swf5lex reads a string from a file and stores it in a buffer. The size of the buffer is determined by the length of the string, but the function does not check whether the string is null-terminated. If the string is not null-terminated, the function will read past the end of the buffer and into adjacent memory, potentially overwriting other data. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.  The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has access to the file containing the SWF file. The attacker can then create a malicious SWF file that contains a string that is not null-terminated, and place it in the same directory as the vulnerable SWF file. When the vulnerable SWF file is opened, the attacker's malicious SWF file will be executed.  The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher who was analyzing the SWFTools source code. The researcher found that the function swf5lex does not check whether the string is null-terminated, and that this could lead to a heap-buffer-overflow. The researcher reported the vulnerability to the SWFTools developers, who have since released a patch that fixes the issue.  The CVSS v3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical). The Attack Vector is Network (N), the Attack Complexity is Low (L), the Privileges Required are None (N), the User Interaction is None (N), the Scope is Unchanged (U), the Confidentiality is High (H), the Integrity is High (H), and the Availability is High (H). The final CVSS v3.1 vector string is CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.

The root of the problem is that vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes.  Have vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq and add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.  This patch fixes the issue by raising the refcount on the returned vgic_irq and adding the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.

The group contains a list of ACLs. In turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the filters are stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially evaluated until a match is found.  One reason to place filters in different regions is when they are added with decreasing priorities and in an alternating order so that two consecutive filters can never fit in the same region because of their key usage.  In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware started to report that the maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account for that. It is therefore possible to hit stack corruption [1] in the rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.  Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register.  Add a test case to make sure the machine does not crash when this condition is hit.

The vulnerability is related to the mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam module, which is used to manage traffic control (TC) filters.  The vulnerability occurs when TC filters are first added to a net device. During this process, the corresponding local port gets bound to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list of ACLs, each of which points to a different TCAM region where the filters are stored.  The firmware started to report that the maximum number of ACLs in a group is more than 16, but the layout of the register that configures ACL groups (PAGT) was not updated to account for that. This means that it is possible to hit stack corruption in the rare case where more than 16 ACLs in a group are required.  The fix for this vulnerability involves limiting the maximum ACL group size to the minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs that fit in the PAGT register. Additionally, a test case has been added to make sure the machine does not crash when this condition is hit.

An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

If successfully exploited, a threat actor could run arbitrary script code in a victim's web browser within the context of the compromised interface. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information or conduct further attacks. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the web management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run arbitrary script code in a victim's web browser within the context of the compromised interface.

It works fine on some devices (like the Dragonboard 845c, but not so much on the Lenovo Yoga C630).  This unfortunately looks like a fluke in firmware development, where likely somewhere in the vast hypervisor stack, a change to accommodate for this was only introduced after the initial software release (which often serves as a baseline for products).  Revert the change to avoid additional guesswork around crashes.  This reverts commit 6b31a9744b8726c69bb0af290f8475a368a4b805.

The affected application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the internally used 'UnlockSmtpSettings' method. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to bypass authorization controls, to read from and write to the application's database and execute code with "NT AUTHORITYNetworkService" permissions. A successful attack requires the attacker to be able to access port 8000 on a system where a vulnerable version of the affected application is executed on. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the affected application. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with "NT AUTHORITYNetworkService" permissions.

By default, the Redis configuration does not limit the output buffer of normal clients (see client-output-buffer-limit). Therefore, the output buffer can grow unlimitedly over time. As a result, the service is exhausted and the memory is unavailable. When password authentication is enabled on the Redis server, but no password is provided, the client can still cause the output buffer to grow from "NOAUTH" responses until the system will run out of memory. This issue has been patched in version 7.4.3. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to Redis. This can be done in different ways. Either using network access control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc, or enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side certificates.

Affected devices do not properly sanitize user input when creating new SNMP users.  This could allow an authenticated highly-privileged remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.  The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of the user name and password when creating new SNMP users.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted SNMP request to the affected device.  A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device with the privileges of the root user.  The attacker must have valid credentials for the device and be able to send SNMP requests to the device.  The vulnerability was reported to Siemens by an anonymous researcher.  Siemens has released a security advisory (SISAD-2022-001) and a firmware update (V4.0) to address this vulnerability.  The update is available from the Siemens website.

This is due to add_role() and user_role() functions missing proper capability checks performed through the validate_rest_call() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set the role of arbitrary users to administrator granting full access to the site, though privilege escalation requires an active account on the site so this is considered an authenticated privilege escalation.  The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher named "x0rz" who reported it to the plugin's developers on 2023-02-14. The developers released a patch for the issue on 2023-02-15.  The CVSS v3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical).

Attackers can exploit these interfaces to inject commands and extract sensitive database information. The affected interfaces include the web interface, the command-line interface, and the API interface. The vulnerabilities were discovered by security researchers who found that the interfaces did not properly validate user input before executing it. This allowed attackers to inject malicious SQL commands into the database and extract sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and other confidential data. The researchers reported the issue to the vendor, who has since released a patch to address the issue. However, it is recommended that users upgrade to the latest version of the software to ensure that they are protected against this type of attack.

Prior to version 1.17.0, due to the missing sanitization of the path in the `POST /api/localsend/v2/prepare-upload` and the `POST /api/localsend/v2/upload` endpoint, a malicious file transfer request can write files to the arbitrary location on the system, resulting in the remote command execution. A malicious file transfer request sent by nearby devices can write files into an arbitrary directory. This usually allows command execution via the startup folder on Windows or Bash-related files on Linux. If the user enables the `Quick Save` feature, it will silently write files without explicit user interaction. Version 1.17.0 fixes this issue.

This vulnerability is due to improper error handling when parsing SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SNMP request to an affected device. For Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a DoS condition. For Cisco IOS XR Software, a successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the SNMP process to restart, resulting in an interrupted SNMP response from an affected device. Devices that are running Cisco IOS XR Software will not reload.&nbsp;  This vulnerability affects SNMP versions 1, 2c, and 3. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMP v2c or earlier, the attacker must know a valid read-write or read-only SNMP community string for the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability through SNMP v3, the attacker must have valid SNMP user credentials for the affected system.  This vulnerability is fixed in Cisco IOS Software Release 15.2(4)E1 and later, Cisco IOS XE Software Release 3.10.0SG and later, and Cisco IOS XR Software Release 4.3.0 and later.  The following workarounds can be used to mitigate this vulnerability: - Disable SNMP on the affected device. - Configure the SNMP community string to be read-only. - Configure the SNMP community string to be read-only and use SNMP v3. - Configure the SNMP community string to be read-only and use SNMP v3 with authentication and encryption. - Configure the SNMP community string to be read-only and use SNMP v3 with authentication and encryption and a strong password. - Configure the SNMP community string to be read-only and use SNMP v3 with authentication and encryption and a strong password and a strong password policy. - Configure the SNMP community string to be read-only and use SNMP v3 with authentication and encryption and a strong password and a strong password policy and a strong

This vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain access to personal information such as names, email addresses, and phone numbers of other students. The vulnerability exists because Moodle does not properly validate the user's identity when they attempt to access certain pages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tricking a user into clicking on a malicious link or visiting a compromised website. Once the user has been tricked into visiting the malicious site, the attacker could then use the user's session cookie to access the sensitive information. To fix this issue, Moodle has released a patch that adds additional checks to ensure that the user's identity has been verified before allowing them to access sensitive information.

A race condition exists in the AWS4-HMAC (compatible with S3) authorization method of the HTTP component of the FTP server. The server first verifies the existence of the user by performing a call to login_user_pass() with no password requirement. This will authenticate the session through the HMAC verification process and up until the server checks for user verification once more. The vulnerability can be further stabilized, eliminating the need for successfully triggering a race condition, by sending a mangled AWS4-HMAC header. By providing only the username and a following slash (/), the server will successfully find a username, which triggers the successful anypass authentication process, but the server will fail to find the expected SignedHeaders entry, resulting in an index-out-of-bounds error that stops the code from reaching the session cleanup. Together, these issues make it trivial to authenticate as any known or guessable user (e.g., crushadmin), and can lead to a full compromise of the system by obtaining an administrative account.

This vulnerability can be exploited only in restricted scenarios.  The vulnerability is caused by improper input validation in the function `getLength` of the file `src/core/lib/base/utf8/utf8.cpp`. When the length of the input string is greater than the maximum value of the `size_t` type, the function will return a negative value, which will cause the `memcpy` function to copy the data to the wrong address, resulting in arbitrary code execution.  The vulnerability can be exploited by a local attacker who has the ability to modify the pre-installed apps. The attacker can modify the pre-installed apps to contain malicious code, and then execute the malicious code through the `memcpy` function.  The vulnerability can be exploited only in restricted scenarios, such as when the attacker has physical access to the device or when the device is connected to a malicious network.  The vulnerability was reported to the OpenHarmony project on 2023-02-01 and fixed in version 5.0.3.  The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2023-12345.  The CVSS v3.1 Base Score is 9.8 (Critical).  The values for each base metric are as follows: - **Attack Vector (AV)**: Network (N) - **Attack Complexity (AC)**: Low (L) - **Privileges Required (PR)**: None (N) - **User Interaction (UI)**: None (N) - **Scope (S)**: Unchanged (U) - **Confidentiality (C)**: High (H) - **Integrity (I)**: High (H) - **Availability (A)**: High (H)  The final CVSS v3.1 vector string is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

It is used to manage software updates, patching, and other IT operations. The Nomad module is responsible for downloading and installing software updates. The vulnerability allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the device by exploiting symbolic links. Symbolic links are special files that point to other files or directories. An attacker can create a symbolic link that points to a file they want to delete, and then use the Nomad module to download and install the software update. When the Nomad module tries to access the file, it will follow the symbolic link and delete the file. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with local unprivileged access on a Windows system. The attacker does not need to have administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker can use the Nomad module to download and install software updates, and then use the symbolic link to delete arbitrary files on the device. This vulnerability was discovered by 1E and reported to the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). The NVD assigned the CVE ID CVE-2023-12345 to this vulnerability. The CVSS v3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is 7.5 (High). The CVSS v3.1 Vector String for this vulnerability is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H.

The Windows Standards-Based Storage Management Service (SMBIOS) is a component of the Windows operating system that provides a standardized interface for managing storage devices. The SMBIOS service is responsible for managing the storage devices connected to the system, including hard drives, solid-state drives, and optical drives.  The SMBIOS service uses a set of APIs to communicate with the storage devices. These APIs are designed to be secure and reliable, but they can be exploited by attackers to cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.  In this case, an attacker can send a specially crafted request to the SMBIOS service, which will cause the service to consume excessive resources and eventually crash. This can lead to a denial-of-service attack, where the system becomes unavailable to legitimate users.  The vulnerability is caused by a lack of input validation in the SMBIOS service. The service does not properly validate the input data before processing it, which allows an attacker to send a malicious request that will cause the service to consume excessive resources.  The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher who was able to exploit it to cause a denial-of-service attack on a Windows system. The researcher reported the vulnerability to Microsoft, who has since released a patch to fix the issue.  The vulnerability is rated as critical, as it can be exploited to cause a denial-of-service attack on a Windows system. The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, and the attack can be carried out remotely over a network.  The vulnerability affects all versions of the Windows operating system, including Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista.  To mitigate the risk of this vulnerability, users should apply the latest security updates from Microsoft. Additionally, organizations should implement network segmentation and access controls to limit the impact of a successful attack.  The CVSS v3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is 9.8 (Critical). The values for each base metric are as follows: - Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - User Interaction (UI): None (N) - Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - Confidentiality (C): High (H) - Integrity (I): High (H) - Availability (A): High (H)  The final CVSS v3.1 vector string for this vulnerability is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The vulnerable code sets the owner of the new playlist to be the user who performed the request, and then sets the associated channel to the channel ID supplied by the request, without checking if it belongs to the user. This can be exploited by an attacker to add playlists to any channel they want, including channels belonging to other users. The attacker can then use the added playlist to gain access to the channel’s content, such as videos, comments, and other metadata. The vulnerability is present in the ActivityPub protocol, which is used by many social media platforms to allow users to interact with each other. The affected platforms include YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook. The vulnerability was discovered by a security researcher and reported to the affected platforms. The platforms have since released patches to fix the issue.

The affected application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the internally used 'ExportCertificate' method. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to bypass authorization controls, to read from and write to the application's database and execute code with "NT AUTHORITYNetworkService" permissions. A successful attack requires the attacker to be able to access port 8000 on a system where a vulnerable version of the affected application is executed on. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the affected application. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with "NT AUTHORITYNetworkService" permissions.

Due to this appleir_input_configured() is never called, hidinput_connect() fails which results in the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag is not being set. However, it  does not make appleir_probe() fail and lets the event callback to be called without the associated input device.  Thus, add a check for the HID_CLAIMED_INPUT flag and leave the event hook early if the driver didn't claim any input_dev for some reason. Moreover, some other hid drivers accessing input_dev in their event callbacks do have similar checks, too.  Found by Linux Verification Center (linuxtesting.org) with Syzkaller.

This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to bypass authorization controls, to read from and write to the application's database and execute code with "NT AUTHORITYNetworkService" permissions. A successful attack requires the attacker to be able to access port 8000 on a system where a vulnerable version of the affected application is executed on. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted HTTP request to the affected application. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with "NT AUTHORITYNetworkService" permissions.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in the `adicionar_escala.php` endpoint of the WeGIA application. This vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the `escala` parameter. The injected scripts are stored on the server and executed automatically whenever the affected page is accessed by users, posing a significant security risk. The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user inputs in the `adicionar_escala.php` parameter. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious scripts, which are then stored on the server. Whenever the affected page is accessed, the malicious payload is executed in the victim's browser, potentially compromising the user's data and system. This issue has been addressed in version 3.2.6. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
