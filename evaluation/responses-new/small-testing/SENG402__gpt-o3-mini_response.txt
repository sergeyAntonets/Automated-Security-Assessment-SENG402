Below is the reasoning for determining each metric:

• Attack Vector (AV): Network (N)  
  The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via web requests, so the attacker does not need local access.

• Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L)  
  Exploitation does not require special conditions beyond triggering the XSS payload.

• Privileges Required (PR): None (N)  
  No authentication or special privileges are needed to inject the malicious input.

• User Interaction (UI): Required (R)  
  A victim must visit or interact with the affected page for the stored XSS to trigger.

• Scope (S): Unchanged (U)  
  The vulnerability does not affect components beyond the defined security boundary.

• Confidentiality (C): Low (L)  
  Exploitation may allow an attacker to gain access to limited information (e.g., session tokens or other sensitive data via the browser), though not full system takeover.

• Integrity (I): Low (L)  
  The attacker’s injected script could modify how content is rendered or steal data, causing partial integrity impact.

• Availability (A): None (N)  
  This issue does not directly impact the system’s availability.

Based on these assessments, the final CVSS v3.1 vector string is:  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####3#####
Based on the description, here is how we can interpret and assign the CVSS v3.1 base metric values:

1. Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability “allows local attackers” to trigger the flaw. Since the attacker must already be on the system to trigger the vulnerability, the attack vector is considered Local (L).

2. Attack Complexity (AC): There is no mention of the exploit requiring any special conditions or additional steps beyond having local access. This means the complexity is Low (L).

3. Privileges Required (PR): The description does not indicate that the attacker must have elevated or specific privileges. Even though the attacker is local, if an unprivileged (or regular) local user is sufficient, then no special privileges are required. So we assign Privileges Required as None (N).

4. User Interaction (UI): There is no indication that exploiting the vulnerability depends on any additional user interaction beyond the attacker’s own actions. Therefore, User Interaction is None (N).

5. Scope (S): The vulnerability is confined to the affected component (the shared library libsthmbc.so) and, there is no evidence that successful exploitation would impact resources beyond its own security boundary. Hence, Scope is Unchanged (U).

6. Confidentiality (C): An out‐

#####4#####
Based on the description, here’s the reasoning for each metric:

• Attack Vector (AV): The injection is performed over the web (an HTTP request) via the web‐accessible widget, so the attacker does not need physical or local access. We choose Network (N).

• Attack Complexity (AC): There are no additional conditions required (such as environment configuration or timing issues) beyond the injected payload itself. So, AC is Low (L).

• Privileges Required (PR): Only authenticated users with contributor-level or higher privileges can use the widget to inject the payload. This is more than “none” but less than administrative, so PR is Low (L).

• User Interaction (UI): After the injection is stored, a victim must view the compromised page for the script to execute. Therefore, UI is Required (R).

• Scope (S): The impact is confined to the affected web page/widget within the same application boundary, so the scope remains Unchanged (U).

• Confidentiality (C): The attacker can potentially steal information (such as cookies/session data from the victim) but does not have full control over all data. Thus, the confidentiality impact is Low (L).

• Integrity (I): The injected script may modify what a user sees or alter page content in the victim’s browser, so the integrity impact is Low (L).

• Availability (A): There is no indication that the attack impacts system availability or causes DoS conditions, so the impact on availability is None (N).

The final CVSS v3.1 vector string is as follows:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

Below is the reasoning for each metric based on the CVE description:

• Attack Vector (AV): The flaw is in ansible‑core and can be triggered remotely (for example, via tasks running on remote-controlled systems). Therefore, AV is Network (N).

• Attack Complexity (AC): The issue is a configuration oversight (failure to prohibit logging in certain scenarios) that does not require any special conditions. Thus AC is Low (L).

• Privileges Required (PR): No special privileges are needed to trigger the behavior – a normal execution task causes the unintended logging. Hence PR is None (N).

• User Interaction (UI): The vulnerability does not require any additional user action beyond what is normally done to run ansible tasks. So UI is None (N).

• Scope (S): The impact is confined to the affected ansible‑core component (information disclosure) without affecting other components. This means Scope is Unchanged (U).

• Confidentiality (C): Sensitive information (possibly including decrypted secrets) may be exposed in logs. This represents a High (H) impact on confidentiality.

• Integrity (I): There is no indication that data can be modified, so Integrity is None (N).

• Availability (A): The flaw does not impact service availability, so Availability is None (N).

Now, assuming CVSS numerical values as defined in the CVSS v3.1 specification, we have:
 • AV:N → 0.85
 • AC:L → 0.77
 • PR:N (for Unchanged Scope) → 0.85
 • UI:N → 0.85

The Impact sub-score is computed solely based on the Confidentiality impact (C is High = 0.56, while I and A are 0):
 ISS = 1 – [(1 – 0.56) × (1 – 0) × (1 – 0)] = 1 – 0.44 = 0.56
 Impact = 6.42 × ISS = 6.42 × 0.56 ≈ 3.595

The Exploitability sub-score is:
 Exploitability = 8.22 × 0.85 × 0.77 × 0.85 × 0.85 ≈ 8.22 × 0.4729 ≈ 3.89

Since Scope is Unchanged, the Base Score is the minimum of (Impact + Exploitability) and 10:
 Base Score = round up (min(3.595 + 3.89, 10), 1) = round up (7.485, 1) ≈ 7.5

Thus, the final CVSS v3.1 vector is:
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

Based on the description provided, here is the analysis for each base metric:

• Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) – The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
• Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) – There are no special conditions or unpredictable circumstances beyond sending the crafted request.
• Privileges Required (PR): None (N) – The attacker does not need any special privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
• User Interaction (UI): Required (R) – The exploitation typically relies on a victim interacting with the malicious payload (for example, clicking a crafted link).
• Scope (S): Unchanged (U) – The exploited vulnerability affects components within the same security scope.
• Confidentiality (C): Low (L) – Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to exfiltrate some user information, but the impact is limited.
• Integrity (I): Low (L) – The vulnerability might allow some manipulation of client-side content though with limited impact.
• Availability (A): None (N) – There is no impact on system availability.

The final CVSS v3.1 vector string is:  
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

#####8#####
Based on the description, here’s the analysis of each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric:

• Attack Vector (AV): Since the vulnerability is exploitable over a web interface/API, the attack is carried out over a network.  
  Value: N (Network)

• Attack Complexity (AC): The exploitation does not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted API request.  
  Value: L (Low)

• Privileges Required (PR): The text specifies “authenticated remote code execution,”

#####9#####
Based on the CVE description provided, we can break down the analysis as follows:

• Attack Vector (AV): The description mentions that “it is possible to initiate the attack remotely.” This indicates that the attack can be performed over the network.  
  AV = N

• Attack Complexity (AC): There is no indication that additional conditions or an environment setup is required beyond sending a request; hence, we consider the complexity to be low.  
  AC = L

• Privileges Required (PR): The description does not indicate that an attacker needs any credentials or elevated privileges to exploit the vulnerability, so no privileges are required.  
  PR = N

• User Interaction (UI): There is no mention of user interaction being necessary; the exploitation can occur without any further action by any user.  
  UI = N

• Scope (S): The vulnerability involves a function within a file and does not suggest that compromising this component impacts resources beyond its boundary. Therefore, the scope is considered unchanged.  
  S = U

• Confidentiality (C): Given that the vulnerability leads to an unrestricted file upload, an attacker may be able to execute remote code or access sensitive data. Thus, the impact on confidentiality is high.  
  C = H

• Integrity (I): An attacker might modify the system by uploading unauthorized files that can alter system behavior, which means the integrity impact is high.  
  I = H

• Availability (A): Since the vulnerability allows arbitrary uploads, there is a risk to availability (for example, by uploading files that disrupt normal services) so the impact is high.  
  A = H

Combining these values, the final CVSS v3.1 Vector String is:

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
