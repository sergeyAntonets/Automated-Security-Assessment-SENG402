To calculate the CVSS v3.1 Base Score, we need to determine the values for each base metric based on the provided CVE description.

CVE Description: In the Linux kernel through 6.7.1, there is a use-after-free in cec_queue_msg_fh, related to drivers/media/cec/core/cec-adap.c and drivers/media/cec/core/cec-api.c.

Based on the description, we can infer the following metric values:

- Attack Vector (AV): Network (N) - since the vulnerability is in the Linux kernel, it is likely accessible by an attacker via the network.
- Attack Complexity (AC): High (H) - as a use-after-free vulnerability, exploitation might require a high level of complexity.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - as there is no mention of needing specific privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) - no user interaction is required for the exploit.
- Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - the impact is localized and does not change the scope of the attack.
- Confidentiality (C): None (N) - as no mention of data exposure or theft is provided.
- Integrity (I): High (H) - use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, indicating a high impact on integrity.
- Availability (A): High (H) - this type of vulnerability can lead to a denial of service or system crash, affecting availability.

Based on the above analysis, the CVSS v3.1 vector string would be:
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

Based on the provided CVE description, we can determine the values for each base metric:

- **Attack Vector (AV)**: The attack complexity is such that an authorized user is required to execute the XSS attack, changing the attack vector to Local (L).
- **Attack Complexity (AC)**: The complexity of the attack is low as described, so the Attack Complexity is Low (L).
- **Privileges Required (PR)**: The user needs to have some privileges to trigger the vulnerability, so Privileges Required is Low (L).
- **User Interaction (UI)**: User interaction is required to execute the XSS attack, so User Interaction is Required (R).
- **Scope (S)**: The impact is within the application's existing security context, so Scope remains unchanged (U).
- **Confidentiality (C)**: The vulnerability allows for the potential confidential data disclosure, thus Confidentiality impact is marked as High (H).
- **Integrity (I)**: The vulnerability allows unauthorized modification of data integrity, thus Integrity impact is marked as High (H).
- **Availability (A)**: The vulnerability does not directly impact system availability, thus Availability impact is marked as None (N).

Calculating the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:
- AV = (0.395) Network (N), (0.646) Adjacent (A), (1.032) Local (L), (1.395) Physical (P)
- AC = 0.35 Low (L), 0.61 High (H)

- Attack Complexity (AC): Low (L) - The exploit is relatively simple.
- Privileges Required (PR): None (N) - No privileges are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- User Interaction (UI): None (N) - No user interaction is required.
- Scope (S): Unchanged (U) - The vulnerability does not impact the entire system.
- Confidentiality (C): Low (L) - Allows access to limited data.
- Integrity (I): Low (L) - Allows unauthorized modification of data.
- Availability (A): None (N) - Does not impact availability.

Calculating the CVSS v3.1 Base Score:
- AV:N = 0.85
- AC:L = 0.77

Formula: Base Score = 8.22 * C * I * A / (0.6 * (1 - 0.6))

Base Score = 8.22 * 0.22 * 0.22 * 0 / (0.6 * (1 - 0.6)) = 0 (rounded down to the nearest integer)

Therefore, the CVSS v3.1 Base Score for this vulnerability is 0.
