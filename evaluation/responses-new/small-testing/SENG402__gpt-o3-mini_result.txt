Based on the description, here is how we can interpret and assign the CVSS v3.1 base metric values:

1. Attack Vector (AV): The vulnerability “allows local attackers” to trigger the flaw. Since the attacker must already be on the system to trigger the vulnerability, the attack vector is considered Local (L).

2. Attack Complexity (AC): There is no mention of the exploit requiring any special conditions or additional steps beyond having local access. This means the complexity is Low (L).

3. Privileges Required (PR): The description does not indicate that the attacker must have elevated or specific privileges. Even though the attacker is local, if an unprivileged (or regular) local user is sufficient, then no special privileges are required. So we assign Privileges Required as None (N).

4. User Interaction (UI): There is no indication that exploiting the vulnerability depends on any additional user interaction beyond the attacker’s own actions. Therefore, User Interaction is None (N).

5. Scope (S): The vulnerability is confined to the affected component (the shared library libsthmbc.so) and, there is no evidence that successful exploitation would impact resources beyond its own security boundary. Hence, Scope is Unchanged (U).

6. Confidentiality (C): An out‐

Based on the description, here’s the analysis of each CVSS v3.1 Base Metric:

• Attack Vector (AV): Since the vulnerability is exploitable over a web interface/API, the attack is carried out over a network.  
  Value: N (Network)

• Attack Complexity (AC): The exploitation does not require special conditions beyond sending a crafted API request.  
  Value: L (Low)

• Privileges Required (PR): The text specifies “authenticated remote code execution,”
